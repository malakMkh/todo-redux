Redux
I started using Redux in this project to make it easier to manage my state. Redux To provides a number of helpful features, such as creating actions and reducers, and managing the store.

To use Redux , I first installed the @reduxjs and react-redux packages. Then, I created a Redux state slice for my theme. The state slice contains the current theme, as well as a function to change the theme.

I also created a Redux store and provided it to React. Finally, I used the Redux state and actions in my React components.

I found Redux to be very easy to use. It made it much easier to manage my state, and it helped me to write cleaner code.
